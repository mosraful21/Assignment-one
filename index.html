            <h1>Dangerous time of Sylhet</h1>
            <p class="details">Earlier in April, unusual flooding hit the low-lying parts of Sylhet. The north-eastern city experienced its worst flood in 18 years in May. Disaster has now hit the city again before its residents recovered fully from the suffering caused by the previous flood. 

                The Surma was flowing 97 cm and 28 cm above the danger level at the Kanaighat and Sylhet points respectively at noon on Thursday, said Asif Ahmed, executive engineer of the Bangladesh Water Development Board.
                
                The Sari River is flowing 37 cm above the danger level. The water level has increased in the Kushiyara and Lobha rivers as well.</p>
